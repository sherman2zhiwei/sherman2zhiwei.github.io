          <p class="lead">At the core, I'm just a curious guy who loves challenging problems. I grew up tinkering with robotics and creating blogs, which introduced me to the world of programming. I enjoy using code to create products that solve challenging problems, so I decided to pursue a career in computer science. My curious nature took me to many domains, from cybersecurity and game development, to machine learning and even business operations. I can't wait to see where it will lead me to in the future. One day, I dream of creating a start-up, and selling a product I can call my own.</p>
          <p class="lead">These days, I'm looking to become an expert in backend development. My last job at MIMOS Berhad (National Applied R&D Centre) exposed me to many roles. I designed system architectures for IoT analytics solutions, built data pipelines, created streaming analytics for manufacturing firms and improved data visualization platforms. This opportunity sparked my curiosity in creating scalable services, hence developing a backend service that serves millions of users is my next exciting new challenge.</p>
          <p class="lead">Right now, I'm actively looking for a job in Korea. Outside of work, I enjoy creating personal projects and testing business ideas. Here's to chasing dreams.</p>
